# Bootstrap
In order to bootstrap the Neovim configuration,\
you can use this git command: "git clone https://github.com/LunamNauta/NeovimDotfiles $env:LOCALAPPDATA/nvim"

# Functions
## This configuration has a few functions that allow you to interface with github, these include:

#### :EditConfig
This opens a buffer to init.lua.\
This allows for easy access to the configuration, without having to search for it in a file explorer.

### Others will come
The remaining functions (DownloadConfig, UploadConfig, and ReloadConfig) were removed due to them being OS dependent.\
I'll add them back later when I find a good alternative for linux and windows both
